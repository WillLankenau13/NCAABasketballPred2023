# Introduction

This repository contains the code for a project where we predicted the results of March Madness games for a Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2023/overview). We completed this project in a small group; I collected and tidied data (code in this repository) while a teammate created a machine-learning model to generate the game predictions.
